                <h3>Breathing exercises</h3>
              <P>Box breathing, or square breathing, is a simple and effective technique to reduce anxiety and manage stress. It involves inhaling deeply through the nose for a count of four, holding the breath for four counts, exhaling slowly through the mouth for another four counts, and then pausing for four counts before repeating the cycle. This exercise calms the mind by activating the parasympathetic nervous system, lowering heart rate, and reducing stress hormones. Box breathing is easy to do anywhere and can bring immediate relief, making it a great tool for managing anxiety and promoting relaxation.</P>
